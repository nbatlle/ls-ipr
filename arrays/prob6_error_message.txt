names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

#The error in the second line is attempting to access an array value with a string instead of an index.
#The interpreter is expecting an integer to know which index to access, and it doesn't know how to turn 'margaret' into an integer.
#'margaret' is the 4th item and has na index of 3, so names['margaret'] should read names[3]
